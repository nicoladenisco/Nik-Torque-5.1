    <p>
      This folder contains references on how to use the Torque generator
      as general-purpose code generator.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Torque generator aims to achieve the following objectives:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Small conceptual and configurational overhead</li>
      <li>Output from existing templates should be easily modifiable</li>
      <li>Not bound to a single template language</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Currently, the following template languages are provided out of the box:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Velocity</li>
      <li>Groovy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Running the Torque generator requires JDK 1.8 or higher.</p>
