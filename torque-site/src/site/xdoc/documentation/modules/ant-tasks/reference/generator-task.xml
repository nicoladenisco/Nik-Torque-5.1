  <title>Torque Ant Tasks - Generator Task</title>
 </properties>

 <body>
  <section name="Generator Task">
    <p>
      The generator task is defined as follows in the build file:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
  <taskdef
    name="torque-generator"
    classpathref="ant-classpath"
    classname="org.apache.torque.ant.task.TorqueGeneratorTask"/>
    ]]></source>
    <p>
      The generator task has the following configuration parameters:
    </p>
    <subsection name="Attributes">
      <p>
        Packaging attributes: They define where the generation unit
        (also known as "templates") is located.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          packaging: The packaging type of the generation unit,
          either "directory" , "jar" or "classpath". Default is "directory".
        </li>
        <li>
          configDir: The configuration directory of the torque generator.
          Has no effect if packaging is "classpath".
        </li>
        <li>
          configPackage: The configuration package of the generation unit.
          Has only effect if packaging is "classpath".
          
         <i>Hint</i>: If you use the prefined Torque Templates the package is
          <code>org.apache.torque.templates.om</code>.
          
        </li>
        <li>
          jarFile: The filename of the jar file of the generation unit.
          Has only effect if packaging is "jar".
        </li>
        <li>
          overrideConfigDir: The config directory of the project
          overriding the defined generation unit.
          If set, the settings of this directory are used as child
          and the "normal" settings are used as parent.
          See the
          <a href="../../../codegen-reference/concepts.html#Overriding">generator reference</a>
          for details.
        </li>
        <li>
          projectRootDir: The root directory of the project.

        </li>
        <li>
          sourceIncludes: Include patterns for the source files.
          If set, the include and exclude patterns from the templates
          are overridden.
          If not set, then the include patterns from the templates are used.
          The patterns are case sensitive, wildcards are * and ?.

        <li>
          sourceExcludes: Exclude patterns for the source files.
          If set, the include and exclude patterns from the templates
