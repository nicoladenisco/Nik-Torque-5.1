<subsection name="Setting up the classpath">

<p>
  The libraries which the generated classes depend on
  are specified in the file <em>pom.xml</em>
  in the top level directory of the project.
  You already created this file in step 1 of the
  tutorial; and it already contains the dependencies
  to the Torque runtime, the mysql driver, and log4j,
  so nothing needs to be changed there.
</p>

<p>
  <b>
    Note: There is no need to include the torque-generator
    or torque-templates dependencies in your project.
  </b>

<subsection name="Building the sample application">

<p>
  Now that you've generated your object model with
  Torque, and created a sample application, you are
  now ready to compile and build everything.  Again, Maven is used
  to control the build process.
  You can build your application
  by typing the following in the top-level directory
  of your project:
</p>

<source><![CDATA[
mvn package
]]></source>

<p>
  If you've done everything correctly, this should
  build without any errors.  This means all of the source files
  will have been compiled to the target/classes folder 
  and all libraries on which your application depends on
  will have been copied to the target/dependency folder.
  If the compiler misses any external libraries, review the
  &lt;dependencies&gt; section in your
  <em>project.xml</em>.  Should you
  encounter other errors, go back and review your
  application code.
</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Running the sample application">

<p>
  Before you run the sample application, you must
  first set your classpath (this was done
  automatically for you by Maven when you
  compiled).  The classpath must include most
  of the jars in the target/dependency folder
  (There are some jars which are transitive dependencies to other jars
  which are not used, but there is no harm in including these).
  The classpath alsmo must include all of your application
  and object model classes located in <em>target/classes</em>.
  To run the application, change into the target directory
  of the application and type

  If your application throws an exception, it could be
  for one of many reasons, most of which are not very
  descriptive unfortunately.  Do not be discouraged if your
  application does not run the first time.  Carefully
  retrace all of the steps outlined in this tutorial.
  If you are still not able to get your application to
  run, use the Torque user
  <a href="../../../mail-lists.html">mailing list</a> to your
  advantage.

<p>
  Congratulations!  You have completed the Torque ORM
  tutorial.  Although this has only been an introduction
  to Torque, it should be sufficient to get you started
  with Torque in your applications.  For those of you
  seeking additional information, there are several other
  documents on this site that can provide details on
  various subjects.  Lastly, the source code is an
  invaluable resource when all else fails to provide
  answers!
