  <section name="Database independence">
    <p>
      The generated java code is database independent. 
      This means that you do not have to re-generate the java code
      in order to run it on another database.
      However, there are a few points to observe:
      <ul>
        <li>Not all data types are available on all databases.</li>
        <li>
          Available data types may behave differently on different databases.
          E.g. Oracle's date type contains time information as well,
          in contrast to all other databases.
          
        </li>
        <li>
          The maximum length of table names and column names is different
          between different databases. From current knowledge, table names
          shorter than 27 characters and column names shorter than
          31 characters are safe to use in all databases.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The generated SQL is database dependent (of course).
