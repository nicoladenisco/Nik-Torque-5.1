  <section name="Introduction">
    
    <p>
      This Reference contains information about how to use Torque as 
      a Object-Relational mapper (a tool that maps from relational databases
      to java classes). 
      Torque 4.0 requires JDK 1.6 or higher, Torque 5.0,5.1 JDK 1.8 or higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      To access a database with Torque, the following steps are needed, 
      which are described in this documentation in detail:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Define a schema file describing the database structure 
        (tables, columns etc.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Generate classes and database creation files from the schema.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the generated classes (and the torque-runtime library classes)
        to access the database.
      </li>
    </ul>
