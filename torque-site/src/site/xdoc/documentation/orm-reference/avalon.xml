  	<title>Using Torque as an Avalon Component</title>
    <author email="tv@apache.org">Thomas Vandahl</author>
 </properties>

 <body>

  <section name="General">
    <p>
     Torque has provided Avalon Component support for some time now. This little
     HowTo should provide the necessary information to use Torque with some Avalon 
     containers, namely ECM, Merlin and Fulcrum-YAAFI.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section name="Configuration">
    <p>
     The configuration is straightforward. Use the following snippet to make
     the Torque component available in your container:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
<role-list>
    <role
        name="org.apache.torque.avalon.Torque"
        shorthand="Torque"
        default-class="org.apache.torque.avalon.TorqueComponent"/>
</role-list>
]]></source>
    <p>
     Torque will need access to its configuration file, so the component 
     configuration looks like this:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
<componentConfig>
    <Torque>
      <configFile>/WEB-INF/conf/Torque.properties</configFile>
    </Torque>
</componentConfig>
]]></source>
    <p>
     The path of the configuration file is relative to the application root
     of the container.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section name="Use">

    <p>
     All access to the Torque component should go through the 
     <code>org.apache.torque.avalon.Torque</code> interface. It provides all methods
     available in <code>TorqueInstance</code>.
     The role name to lookup the component in your container is also
     <code>org.apache.torque.avalon.Torque</code>.
    </p>
