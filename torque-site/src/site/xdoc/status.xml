      <subsection name="20 September 2012 - Torque-4.0-beta1 released">
        <p>
          This release of the Torque 4 branch allows feedback
          before the 4.0 release.
          The main changes with respect to Torque 3.3 are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The "look and feel" of Torque 3 was maintained.</li>
          <li>The generator is now a general-purpose code generator.</li>
          <li>
            As the templates are now modular, it is easy to extend or modify
            the generated code without having to replace the whole templates.
          </li>
          <li>
            A new Criteria implementation was created, with slightly 
            changed semantics. 
            The old Criteria implementation was retained but deprecated.
          </li>
          <li>Prepared statements are sued throughout all queries.</li>
          <li>Column names are now encapsulated in objects.</li>
        </ul>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="16 February 2010 - new Generator, Templates and Maven plugin">
        <p>
          The generator was replaced with a brand-new general purpose code
          generator. The templates have been adopted to match this change.
          A new Maven plugin integrates the new generator in a Maven 2/3 build.
          An Ant tasks project integrates the new generator in an Ant build.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="07 September 2008 - Torque 4 branch created">
        <p>
          The idea of Torque 4 is to allow major reworking of the internals
          of Torque 3. The usage of Torque should not change much,
          however, some more exotic features could change.
          Some of the ideas are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Replace the village library</li>
          <li>Provide an alternative to the static peer classes</li>
          <li>...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Ideas and help are very welcome. Join the
