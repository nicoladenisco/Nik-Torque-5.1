     <p>
       <a href="http://fabforce.net/dbdesigner4/">DBDesigner</a> is a tool which 
       helps with database design. It is made for MySQL databases, mostly. 
       DBDesigner kindly stores the model in XML files which contain most 
       information that we need in the Torque schema. So this script was
       created to transform one form into the other.
     </p>
     <p>
       To use the script <a href="tools/D4-Torque.xslt"><code>D4-Torque.xslt</code></a>,
       simply fire up the XSLT-processor of your choice and give it the DBDesigner
       model as an input.
     </p>
     <p>
       This script was made for transforming a certain model into the associated
       Torque schema. So basically, &quot;It works for me&quot;. Mostly the mapping
       of DBDesigner types into Torque types is incomplete. Any patches are welcome
       (as always).
     </p>
     <p>
       DBDesigner is no longer actively being developed. It's successor,
       <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/">MySQL Workbench</a>,
       is as far as we can see, ready, but the format of the
       model files will need adjustment when it's ready.

     <p>
       <a href="http://mogwai.sourceforge.net/erdesigner/erdesigner.html">Mogwai ERDesigner</a>
       is a tool for vizualizing the Database structure which uses an
       XML-based file format.
       The stylesheet <a href="tools/schema2erd.xsl">schema2erd.xsl</a> translates
       a Torque-schema into the mogwai-format.  It transforms entities
       (=tables), attributes (=columns) and relations (=foreign-keys).
     </p>
      
     <p>
       Only the location of the entities is missing so you have to arrange
       them by yourself.  If somebody uses mogwai and Torque, this stylesheet
       may be helpful.
