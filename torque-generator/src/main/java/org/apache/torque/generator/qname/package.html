    <p>
      This package contains classes which provide the implementation
      of a qualified name, i.e. a name whiches lives in a hierarchical
      namespace. "Hierarchical" means that a name is visible in its own
      namespace and all children of this namespace. All objects in the root
      namespace (Namespace.ROOT_NAMESPACE) are visible in all other namespaces.
      All objects living in a namespace are contained in a QualifiedNameMap,
      which contains qualified names as key and the objects which are assigned
      to the name as values. 
    </p>
    
    <p>  
      The keys in this map are objects of type QualifiedName. A QualifiedName
      consists of a Namespace (represented by a Namespace Object), and a name.
      Each QualifiedName must have a namespace, and a non-empty name.
