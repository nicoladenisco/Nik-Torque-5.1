##
## This template creates additional code for tracking whether the object was
## modified in the setter method for a field representing a table column.
## The template expects as input a "column" element from the torque schema, 
## which was processed by the OMTransformer.  
##
#if ($torqueGen.booleanOption("torque.om.trackModified"))
  #if ($primitive == "true")
        if (this.$field != v)
  #else
        if (!Objects.equals(this.$field, v))
  #end
        {
            setModified(true);
        }
#end
