## This template is invoked in the object representing the "foreign"
## part of a foreign key. It creates the methods which allow access for the 
## "local" side objects of a foreign key. 
## The template expects as input a "foreign-field" element inside a 
## "foreign-key" element from the torque schema, which was generated 
## by the OMTransformer.
