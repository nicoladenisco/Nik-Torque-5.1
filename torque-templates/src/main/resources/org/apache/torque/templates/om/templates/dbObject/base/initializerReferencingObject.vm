## This template creates the initializer method in the object for the 
## "foreign" part of a foreign key. The initialized object collection represents
## the "local" side of the foreign key.  
## The template expects as input a "foreign-field" element inside a 
## "foreign-key" element from the torque schema, which was generated 
## by the OMTransformer.
