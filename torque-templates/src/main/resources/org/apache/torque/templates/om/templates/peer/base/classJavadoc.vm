## Creates the class javadoc for a base peer object. 
## 
## This template expects the current source element to be a "table" element 
## from the torque schema.
## The schema needs to be processed by the OMTransformer.
## The options and the attributes of the current source element must be set
## as velocity variables.

 * The skeleton for this class was autogenerated by Torque on:
 *
 * [${torqueGen.now()}]
 *
#end
 * You should not use this class directly.  It should not even be
 * extended; all references should be to $peerClassName
