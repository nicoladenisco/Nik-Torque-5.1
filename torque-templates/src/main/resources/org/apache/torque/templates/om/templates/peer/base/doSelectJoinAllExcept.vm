## Creates the doSelectJoinAllExceptXXX methods for the base peer class.
##
## This template expects the current source element to be a "foreign-field" 
## element from the torque schema which was processed by the OMTransformer.
## The options and the attributes of the current source element must be set
## as velocity variables.
